                      <h5>SUBURBANIZATION IN UFA. Investigating agglomeration functionality to tackle suburbanization.</h5>
                      <p>This research project aims to develop a proposal to mitigate the effects of suburbanization by reorganizing the agglomeration.<br><br>Ufa is an industrial city in central Russia. It has a population of over one and a half million people. It locates on a peninsula situated between two rivers. The city is a center of regional agglomeration and consequently experiences all drawbacks of suburbanization processes. With the concentration of jobs, limited access points, and scarcity of free land lots, the peninsula is overloaded with commuting. The project considers suburbanization processes at the agglomeration scale. It suggests the reorganization of workplaces, the movement trajectory of a high-speed mode of transportation with transport hubs, and land use regulations.<br><br> The main issue during the research became the data absence. That is very typical for Russian cities. All data was collected manually and required accuracy and rigorous work. Studying the data analysis became the first tool that helped me to understand “WHY?”. The project gave an impetus for my future development as a data analyst.</p>

                            <p>Today almost every big city around the world faces poor air quality problems. AW|AIR aims to create a mechanism to tackle the issue by activating citizen participation. Thousands of premature deaths in the EU are attributable to high NO2 concentrations. Its primary source is road transport with the highest proportion being private vehicles. That means that air quality is our responsibility. Therefore, public awareness plays a crucial role in tackling the issue. AW|AIR enhances public awareness through gamification towards a positive impact on air quality. During the research development, I applied air quality and mobility data. The game represents both bottom-up and top-down approaches. It consists of incentives, stimuli, conditions, and gratifications. In the event of meeting specific game conditions, each participant achieves gratifications such as public transport discounts and more space dedicated to particular modes of transportation such as micro-mobility. That allows us to prioritize the most active participants and provokes others to revise their everyday means of transportation. The idea of investigating citizen participation was born from my background. Citizen participation in Russia is very limited in all spheres of people's lives on federal and local scales. It was significant for me to learn citizen participation tools applicable in my home country context. That lead me to the next step.  Working for NGO for which constructing and maintaining civil society in the Bashkortostan region was one of the fundamental goals.</p>

                            <p>The research purpose is to conduct a systemic analysis of the historical center of Ufa to propose an evidence-based solution for the cycling and pedestrian infrastructure. The research consists of spatial data analysis of attraction points, transportation, services, cycling activities, land use, etc. The second part included massive social analysis with on-site surveys with citizens. With the support of local volunteers, we gathered opinions and ideas concerning public spaces, to estimate their conditions and level of satisfaction. The result of the research represents the “passport” for each of the 12 investigated public spaces with information about its physical and social conditions such as the number of visitors and their types, the purpose of visit, time spent, type and frequency of cultural events, infrastructural supply, and recommendations for improvements. The second output is a cycling and pedestrian itinerary proposal. The proposal takes into account spatial analysis as well as microclimatic situations. Ufa like many places in European in the last decades faces extreme temperatures and the scarcity of vegetation that affects the convenience of moving through the city. We used summer 2021 satellite images to identify the overheated streets that require additional measures to implement. Our proposal of the itinerary included recommendations for actions that have to occur to provide the city center with cycling and pedestrian infrastructure. The interventions concerned the narrowing of roads and expansion of sidewalks, construction of bike lanes, planting additional vegetation, and arrangement of pedestrian facilities (drinking fountains, benches, etc.) for every section of the street chosen for the itinerary. This research project is the first step in a long way toward proving the necessity of applying the evidence-based approach for every solution made in the city. The full description of the project can be checked on the IUDB webpage. This research became a basement for the future investigation of the impacts of spatial interventions on sociocultural aspects.</p>

                            <p>The project aimed to create a universal methodology to assess the effects of the construction and revival of public spaces. Since 2018 the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation has held a competition for the best projects for public spaces in small and medium cities across the country. The best projects received federal funds for realization. Since then the Republic of Bashkortostan realized 20 public space projects utilizing the federal budget. The IUDB curated all of them from the concept to the opening. In 2022 when the some time has passed since the first public space opened we started to see the effects. At that time the team decided to assess the achieved effects envisaged in the concept. However, every city and public space is unique and demonstrates different effects. How to measure them? The tool of assessment of public spaces' influence on city functioning did not exist in the country. So, the IUDB took the role of pioneer in the sphere. Urban planners, economists, sociologists, and architects united to create a universal tool for the assessment of public spaces' effects in any region regardless of climate, type of space, and funding. The team studied the state-of-the-art world practices and choose the project “Evaluate street transformation” from Global Design Street Initiative as an inspiration. There are 3 types of effects included in the methodology: city planning, economic, and social. Every effect is measured with several parameters that varies depending on the type of public space. Each of the 24 parameters has a special instrument of measurement. These instruments consist of on-site citizen surveys, interviews, measurements, not included observations, open-source data analysis, etc. The methodology also provides the tool for results comparison and helps to conclude. The project received approval and positive feedback on the federal level and at the moment 3 more regions across the country utilize the methodology in their work. The full description of the guidelines can be checked on the IUDB webpage.</p>

                            <p>The research focuses on revealing the correlation between land surface coverage and urban heat island and identifying potential impacts on public health. I appealed to urban heat islands in my previous project related to public space connectivity in Ufa. That time I investigate the issue in Yerevan  – the capital city of Armenia. Armenia is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the ECA region and is expected to face warming at levels significantly above global averages. Life expectancy in Armenia continuously rises and reaches 75 years in 2020. That means the number of people in heat-vulnerable groups increases. However, Armenia and Yerevan do not include urban heat island mitigation measures in their adaptation plans and development strategies. The primary assumption of the research is that the UHI differently affects Yerevan districts mainly because of unequal green public space distribution among city areas. Consequently, the city areas experience heat stress differently. In this research, we focus only on the spatial distribution of heat, its causes, and its effects on public health. The whole research is done based on open-source data. The methodology includes three types of data. To find a correlation between urban green and UHI we used NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and LST (land surface temperature) measurements. Both data samples come from satellite images of Yerevan (2021) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 missions respectively. We fetched demographic data from the last population census (2011). In this research, we use administrative city districts as a measurement unit of the city areas. We divided land surface coverage into five categories. The proportion of categories was calculated for each district based on NDVI. The land surface temperature indicator defined the mean temperature increase for every region. The correlation between the proportions of land surface categories and the average temperature increase in the district was evident. Based on the demographics we defined city districts where the ratio of 75+ population is higher. Higher temperature excess and the high proportion of vulnerable people helped to prioritize areas where the UHI mitigation measures are most in need. This research was presented at the EDRA54 conference in Mexico. The research is my first step in studying the global issue. All further projects one way or another are associated with this experience of working on the border of several disciplines.</p>

To understand the affordability in this examination I used The Housing Affordability Index which measures whether or not a typical family earns enough income to qualify for a mortgage loan on a typical home at the national and regional levels based on the most recent price and income data. The research uses three data sets. The Statistics Committee of the Republic of Armenia presents the average monthly household monetary income. Two other data sets of rental and purchase housing prices were created by data parsing from the local online property market services. Based on three data types I defined the basic parameters required for the housing affordability index. The research results show that the average monthly rental price for 1 room apartment is 20% higher than the average household monthly income. The average household has to save 50% of monthly income for five years to pay a down payment (20% of the housing price). The median household has to save 50% of monthly income for 25 years to buy a home without a mortgage. And only 0.4% of households have income qualifying for mortgage loans. The HAI for Yerevan is 22 means that the typical household has only 22% of the income necessary to purchase the typical home (based on local mortgage regulations and the median prices for a typical home). The research development gave me experience in generating and analyzing big data sets. The next step in this direction is establishing the spatial parameters that affect property prices and typology in Yerevan.</p>
